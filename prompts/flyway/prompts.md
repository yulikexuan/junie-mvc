You can append what you want to mention for this topic into file  `.junie/guidelines.md`

Hi Junie, could you please inspect `.junie/guidelines.md`, 
add a brief section about how flyway migration works with Spring Boot in the end of `.junie/guidelines.md`, 
include information about the default directory and version naming.
