Analyze the `prompts/add-order-shipment/requirements.md` file and create a detailed plan for the improvements of this project. 
Write the plan to `prompts/add-order-shipment/plan.md` file.

--------------------------------------

Create a detailed enumerated task list according to the suggested enhancements plan in 
`prompts/add-order-shipment/plan.md` Task items should have a placeholder [ ] for marking as done [x] upon task completion. 
Write the task list to `prompts/add-order-shipment/tasks.md` file. 

-------------------------------------

Complete the task list `prompts/add-order-shipment/tasks.md`. Inspect the requirements.md and plan.md and task.md (task list). 
Implement the tasks in the task list. Focus on completing the tasks in order. Mark the task complete as it is done 
using [x]. As each step is completed, it is very important to update the task list mark and the task as done [x].
