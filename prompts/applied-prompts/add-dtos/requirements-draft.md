Update the BeerController to use DTOs. 
In the package model, create a new POJO called BeerDto with the same properties as the JPA Entity Beer. 
The DTO should use annotations from Project Lombok, including Builder. 
Create a Mapstruct mapper to convert to and from the DTO. 
Mappers should be added to the package mappers.
When converting from a DTO to the JPA entity ignore the properties for id, createDate and updateDate. 
Convert the service layer to accept DTO objects and to use the Mapstruct mapper for type conversions. 
Update the controller methods to use the new DTO pojo for input and access to service methods.
